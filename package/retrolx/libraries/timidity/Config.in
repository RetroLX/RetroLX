	  TiMidity is a MIDI to WAVE converter that uses Gravis
	  Ultrasound(*)-compatible patch files to generate digital audio data
	  from General MIDI files. The audio data can be played through any
	  sound device or stored on disk. On a fast machine, music can be
	  played in real time. TiMidity runs under Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX, SunOS, and
	  Win32, and porting to other systems with gcc should be easy.
